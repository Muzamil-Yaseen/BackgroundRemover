# BackgroundRemover

This repository offers a Python-based tool for batch removing backgrounds from images using the `rembg` library and `Pillow`. The script processes images stored in the `input_images` folder, saving the background-free versions in the `output_images` folder. It is designed to streamline the process of background removal across multiple image formats.
